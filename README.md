I am quite a rookie with only weird Udemy level of expierence with React and Express. I am afraid i cannot make to the ddl. Even if i submit one OA answer, I still will get rejection due to my terrible resume when i applied to Zendesk. So I will only treat this like a really good practice of MERN project (Much better and harder than coding along with Youtube or Udemy videos).

I majorly consulted two people's repo: 
- [Nick-son](https://github.com/ahgdyycc/zendesk-coding-challenge) who shows a beautiful front end. He uses props a lot.
- [badJK](https://github.com/beastjk07/Zendesk-Coding-Challenge/blob/master/server/index.js) 
- [kurdty](https://github.com/baasitsharief/Zendesk_Coding_Challenge/blob/main/frontend/src/components/Ticket.js) He uses hooks, which i prefer.


**So Now Lets Chill and do this project, which would be another boost to my trash resume.**
